        The <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"><b>WebAim Contrast Checker</b></a>
        not only compares the foreground and background colors but also demonstrates them in use
        with both normal and large text.<br><br>

        Unfortunately it doesn't explain the contrast ratio result immediately, but instead explains how to interpret it.

        <a href="http://www.checkmycolours.com/"><b>Check My Colors</b></a> takes a more automatic approach to testing for sufficient color contrast for accessibility: it renders your page and
        analyzes all foreground/background color combinations on it.
        <br><br>
        In the report table it not only tells you the contrast ratio and where the
        text was found but also shows some sample text with the background from your website.
        This doesn't only demonstrate the problem but also let's you see what the
        problematic page elements are without having to check the HTML.

    <h2>
        Why use a contrast analyzer?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Ensuring sufficient contrast between foreground and
        background colors isn't only essential to make your website
        accessible, it also makes your pages easier to use for all
        visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Color checkers will tell you if someone with color deficits
        can still easily use your site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Automatic tools can use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contrast-ratiodef">WCAG contrast ratio</a>
        and then evaluate it based on the accessibility guidelines and algorithms provided by W3C.
    </p>

    <h2>What do I need to keep in mind when combining colors?</h2>

    <p>
        You need to ensure that colors are different enough and stand out from each other. People with vision deficiencies have trouble differentiating between different hues.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many people have some degree of color blindness. For example about 8% of people with Northern European ancestry have a red-green deficiency and struggle to identify patterns or text using those two colors together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The testing tools above are programmed to detect these issues and make sure that every visitor, customer and user can benefit from your website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most tools aren't able to analyze images,
      so you need to consider how distinguishable your colors are when creating graphic content.
    </p>

    <h2>What accessibility guidelines are there regarding color contrast ratios?</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
        To achieve compliance websites need to adhere to accessibility standards. Sites can be assigned different conformance levels, ranging from A to AAA.
    </p>

    <p>
      For AA compliance a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 is required with a few exceptions, for example for logos or decorative text.
      <br>
      Large text needs to have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1.
    </p>

    <p>
      To conform to the AAA standard a ratio of 7:1 is required between the text and background color.
    </p>
